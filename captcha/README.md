<h3> Captcha </h3>

In this task, you are expected to launch an attack to a system which uses integers between 0 and 10,000 as passwords.


<h5> How to run </h5>

In server directory, run the following command:

`python3 server.py`

In your browser, open http://localhost:8000/. You should find the randomly generated password.
Note that each time you try an incorrect captcha-key combination, the captcha will be refreshed.
Captcha length is fixed and always 6.

Good luck!
