Captcha is used for preventing auto-fill form submission. Yet, the captcha used in this web page is a simple text, and
can be obtained easily by parsing html. After that, one can write a script that mimics the web page. To do so, browser's
developer tools can be used. After inspecting the page, it can be seen how POST request is made. In addition, whenever
the key or captcha is wrong, the server responses with 403. Thus, requests with wrong keys can be differentiated easily.

`exploit.py` is a sample script that sends a GET request, finds the captcha by parsing the html and tries a key. After
repeating this for all possible key values, it finds the correct one in a few minutes.
