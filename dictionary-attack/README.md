<h3> Dictionary Attack </h3>

You have a friend who is bad at remembering things. So, she wrote down a note to a txt file which is
hidden somewhere inside `challenge.zip` because she does not want it to be read by somebody else.
But, she knew that it might be easy to find the txt file and she also set a password to it.
As she is also not good at memorizing passwords, she decided to select such a **COMMON** one that when she forgets it,
she can google common passwords and find it very quickly. You, as her friend, are expected to find the txt file and
crack its password to show your friend that her way of storing passwords is not secure enough.
