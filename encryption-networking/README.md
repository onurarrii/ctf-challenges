<h3> Encryption in Networking </h3>

In this task, you are given a software which is composed of a single file called `client.pyc`. You know that the software's creators
have hidden a secret key in the client program and it is sent to a **remote** server before the program runs. By doing so, the developers
of the software prohibited fake clients to use their server. However, you want to prove them wrong and thus, you need to find the secret key.

Good luck!
