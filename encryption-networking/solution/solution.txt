As client.pyc is a compiled file, it cannot be read directly yet we can obtain clues out of it using 'strings' command.
After running it, the following strings, which might be considered as clues, are obtained:

    1. encrypted_token
    2. z-http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/create

From the first one, we can assume that the secret key might not be stored as a raw string (Note that, if they did store the key
in raw string form, we could probably obtain it at this very step easily). On the other hand, second string might tell us where to send request
to grant access (Note that it sends a request to a mock API. In normal circumstances, you would see server's uri here).

In the second step, we need to watch the network traffic to see request's content. By using wireshark, and filtering
HTTP requests, we can easily find the corresponding packet in which the secret key stored as an HTTP header.

Note: The source code for client.pyc is client.py.
