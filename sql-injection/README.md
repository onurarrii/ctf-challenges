<h3> SQL Injection </h3>

In this task, you are expected to log in without knowing the username/password combination.


<h5> How to run </h5>

Before running, make sure that 8000 and 8001 ports are available.

In server directory, run the following command (Note that, `flask` and `sqlite3` modules should be installed):

`python3 server.py`

In client directory, run the following command:

`python3 -m http.server`

In your browser, open http://localhost:8000/. If you somehow manage to log in, you will see the key.

Good luck!
