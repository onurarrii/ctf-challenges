# Introduction to Computer Security Term Project

The project includes a couple of CTF Challenges with their solutions.

In each task, you are expected to find the key which is in form
CTF{<key_here>}. Each task is in a separate directory and has its own README file
that must be read before beginning to do the task.

To make things simpler, keys are not stored in remote machines so there might be various and possibly easier ways to obtain them.
Try to follow guidelines in README files to have more realistic challenge experience.

Good Luck!
